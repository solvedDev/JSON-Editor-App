# JSON Editor
A basic tool for JSON editing. It has color highlighting, collapsible elements and a bunch of other tools which are making your experience with JSON more convenient.
Visit https://solveddev.github.io/JSON-Editor/ to get started!  
**Important:** I am strongly recommending usage of Chrome. I am not supporting any other browser.

This editor is made specifically for editing Minecraft behavior files. You can also open & edit other JSON files though.


## Features
 - Auto-completions for all behavior files: Entities, loot tables and trades!
 - Expandable using JSON files: You can set up your own stuff very easily
 - Color highlighting
